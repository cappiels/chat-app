## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why does it say "Toast Conversion"?**
A: That's your workspace name! The dialog shows which workspace you're inviting someone to.

**Q: Can I change the workspace name?**
A: Yes! Go to workspace settings and you can rename it to anything you like.

**Q: What if they don't receive the email?**
A: Check their spam folder. Invitations come from your app's email system.

**Q: Can I cancel an invitation?**
A: Contact your admin - they can manage pending invitations.
