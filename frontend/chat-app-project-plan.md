Slack Clone & Knowledge Base: MVP Implementation Plan

1. Summary

This document outlines a streamlined, MVP-first implementation plan for a real-time business communication platform. The initial focus is on delivering the core chat functionality quickly and efficiently on Digital Ocean. Advanced features like the comprehensive knowledge base, freemium model automation, and extreme scalability measures will be phased in after the initial launch.



2. MVP Requirements

2.1 Core Communication (Phase 1)

Multi-Company Support: Securely isolated "workspaces."

User Management: Admins can invite and remove users. Basic profiles (name, email).

Threads (Channels): Public and private group channels.

Direct Messages (DMs): One-on-one conversations.

Real-time Messaging: Sending, editing, and deleting text messages.

File Attachments: Basic file uploads (images, documents).

Search: Simple search across message content within a user's workspace.

Notifications: Basic in-app indicators for new messages.

2.2 Post-MVP Features (Phase 2 & Beyond)

Advanced Knowledge Base: Rich text editor, versioning, public sharing.

Full Freemium Model: Automated throttling and subscription management via Stripe.

Advanced Features: Emoji reactions, user mentions, voice/video calls.

High-Scalability Architecture: Introduce Redis adapter and load-balanced droplets as user growth dictates.

3. Simplified Technical Plan (MVP First)

3.1 Technology Stack (Unchanged)

Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js with Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL (Digital Ocean Managed Database)

Real-time: Socket.IO

Authentication: Firebase Authentication

File Storage: Digital Ocean Spaces

3.2 Simplified MVP Architecture

For a quick launch, we'll start with a simpler, single-server setup. This is cost-effective and significantly faster to deploy.



Deployment Target: Digital Ocean App Platform. This is the fastest way to get started. It can run the Node.js backend and serve the static React frontend from a single place. It also handles scaling, SSL, and deployments from your code repository automatically. This is much simpler than managing individual Droplets, Nginx, and PM2 for the MVP.

Real-time: We will use Socket.IO running directly on the single App Platform instance. We will postpone using the Redis adapter until we need to scale to multiple instances. This removes the need to manage a Managed Redis instance for the MVP.

Database: A single Digital Ocean Managed PostgreSQL instance. This is still the right choice for data integrity and future scaling.

3.3 Database Schema (Simplified for MVP)

We will start with a focused schema and add tables for the knowledge base and subscriptions later.



-- Users table (global, linked to Firebase UID)

CREATE TABLE users (

    id VARCHAR(128) PRIMARY KEY, -- Firebase UID

    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,

    display_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

    profile_picture_url TEXT,

    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

);



-- Workspaces (companies)

CREATE TABLE workspaces (

    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

    owner_user_id VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),

    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

);



-- Junction table for users and workspaces (many-to-many)

CREATE TABLE workspace_members (

    workspace_id UUID REFERENCES workspaces(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    user_id VARCHAR(128) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member', -- 'admin', 'member'

    PRIMARY KEY (workspace_id, user_id)

);



-- Threads (channels or DMs)

CREATE TABLE threads (

    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

    workspace_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES workspaces(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    name VARCHAR(255), -- e.g., 'general', can be NULL for DMs

    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'channel', 'direct_message'

    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

);



-- Junction table for users and threads (many-to-many)

CREATE TABLE thread_members (

    thread_id UUID REFERENCES threads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    user_id VARCHAR(128) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    PRIMARY KEY (thread_id, user_id)

);



-- Messages

CREATE TABLE messages (

    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

    thread_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES threads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    sender_id VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),

    content TEXT,

    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

);



-- Attachments (Simplified)

CREATE TABLE attachments (

    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

    message_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES messages(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    file_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

    file_url TEXT NOT NULL, -- URL to Digital Ocean Spaces

    mime_type VARCHAR(100),

    file_size_bytes BIGINT,

    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

);



-- Indexes for performance

CREATE INDEX idx_messages_thread_id ON messages (thread_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_workspace_members_user_id ON workspace_members (user_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_thread_members_user_id ON thread_members (user_id);

3.4 Deployment Safety Strategy

Given the auto-deploy nature of Digital Ocean App Platform, we need robust safety measures:

**Branch Strategy:**
- `main` branch → Production (auto-deploys to DO App Platform)
- `develop` branch → Staging environment (separate DO App Platform app)
- `feature/*` branches → Individual feature development

**Database Migration Safety:**
- Versioned migration files with UP/DOWN scripts in `/migrations` folder
- Manual database backups before schema changes
- Test migrations on staging database first
- Atomic, reversible database changes

**Rollback Procedures:**
- App rollback: Redeploy previous git commit via DO dashboard
- Database rollback: Execute DOWN migration scripts
- Emergency: Toggle features via environment variables

**Safe Deployment Workflow:**
1. Develop in feature branch with local testing
2. Merge to `develop` → auto-deploy to staging
3. Test on staging environment
4. Create production database backup
5. Merge to `main` → auto-deploy to production
6. Run database migrations manually (not automated)
7. Verify production health

3.5 Phased Rollout Plan

Phase 1: Core Chat MVP

Set up Digital Ocean resources (App Platform, PostgreSQL, Spaces).

Create staging environment and database migration system.

Build backend APIs for users, workspaces, threads, and messages.

Integrate Firebase Auth and DO Spaces for file uploads.

Implement real-time messaging with Socket.IO.

Build the React frontend for core chat functionality.

Deploy to the App Platform with proper staging testing.

Phase 2 & 3: Knowledge Base & Payments

Implement the Knowledge Base features (start with a simpler Markdown editor).

Add the necessary kb_articles and related tables to the database.

Integrate Stripe for manual subscription setup (e.g., admin sets a workspace to "premium").

Build the UI for creating and viewing articles.

Phase 4: Scale & Enhance

Based on user load, migrate from App Platform to multiple Droplets with a Load Balancer and Redis if needed.

Automate the freemium model with Stripe webhooks and backend throttling logic.

Add advanced features like emoji reactions, mentions, and notifications based on user feedback.
