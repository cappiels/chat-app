## 🛡️ Safety Procedures

### Before Each Major Change:
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Test locally with sample data
3. Backup production database (if touching schema)
4. Deploy to staging first
5. Test on staging environment
6. Merge to main for production deploy

### Emergency Rollback:
- **App**: Redeploy previous commit via Digital Ocean dashboard
- **Database**: Run DOWN migration scripts
- **Quick Fix**: Toggle feature flags via environment variables

### Git Branch Strategy:
- `main` → Production (auto-deploys to DO App Platform)
- `develop` → Staging environment
- `feature/*` → Individual features
