# üö® URGENT: Fix Production Deployment NOW

## The Problem
Your production app at `https://coral-app-rgki8.ondigitalocean.app` is running the OLD version of the code that had hardcoded `localhost:8080`.

## The Solution
You need to REDEPLOY the frontend with the new code that uses environment variables.

## üîß IMMEDIATE FIX (Choose One Option)

### Option 1: Redeploy with Environment Variables

```bash
# In your deployment process, set these environment variables:
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com

# Then build and deploy:
npm run build
# Deploy the dist/ folder to your hosting
```

### Option 2: If You Don't Have a Backend Yet

```bash
# Create a temporary backend URL or use a placeholder:
VITE_API_URL=https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

# Build and deploy:
npm run build
```

### Option 3: Quick Local Test

```bash
# Test the fix locally first:
cd frontend
VITE_API_URL=https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/api npm run build
npm run preview
# Check if it works without localhost:8080 calls
```

## üéØ For DigitalOcean App Platform

If using DigitalOcean App Platform:

1. Go to your app dashboard
2. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add:
   - `VITE_API_URL` = `https://your-backend-url.com/api`
   - `VITE_SOCKET_URL` = `https://your-backend-url.com`
4. Trigger a new deployment

## üîç Verify the Fix

After redeploying, check:
1. Open browser console on your production app
2. Should NOT see any `localhost:8080` requests
3. Should see requests to your actual backend URL

## ‚ö° Emergency Workaround

If you need a quick fix without backend:

```bash
# Build with a dummy API that won't fail:
VITE_API_URL=https://httpbin.org/status/200 npm run build
```

**The code is fixed - you just need to redeploy with the new version!**
